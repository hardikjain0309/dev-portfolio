This was my personall Dev Porfolio

## Intention

I wanted to use this portfolio for anyone to know my journey of personal projects; this being my first personal project. But I realized a better time to build this is when I have some projects in my hand to showcase and I have an intended audience to show this to. Hopefully in future this will refactored or archived for a new and better porfolio to showcase tons of projects :)
